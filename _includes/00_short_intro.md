## Welcome

How can we make robots more intelligent? How can we explain decisions robots
make autonomously? These are some of my research interests which led to two
stints at Fujita Laboratory at Tokyo Tech to explore these questions and they
continue to fascinate me. If I'm not pondering robotic intelligence, I enjoy
developing my photography skills, drinking good coffee and doing Aikido.
