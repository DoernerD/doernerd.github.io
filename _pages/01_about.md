## Research Interest

What happens if robots leave the safe environment of the lab? How can we provide
tools that robots can autonomously work their way around in a highly uncertain
environment? But also, how can we explain why a robot decided in a certain way?
These are some of the questions I'm very interested in exploring. After all,
robots will eventually leave the lab, think of the advent of autonomous cars.
Thus answering these questions is more pressing than ever. Working at the
intersection between Control Theory, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics
provides me with the opportunity to explore these questions. 

During my master's thesis research I had the opportunity to work on disturbance
in a passivity-short human swarm interaction model using Gaussian Processes.
