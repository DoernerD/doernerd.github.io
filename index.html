  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  Hi, I'm David. I study Engineering Cybernetics (M.Sc.) and currently do a research exchange at the Tokyo Institute of Technology where I'm with Prof. Fujita and Prof. Yamauchi. If I'm not working on Human-Swarm interaction, I enjoy cooking, a good cup of coffee, and learning Japanese.
