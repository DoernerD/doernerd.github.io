  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  Welcome to my page, I'm David. I study Engineering Cybernetics (M.Sc.) and are currently on research exchange at the Tokyo Institute of Technology where I'm with Prof. Fujita and Prof. Yamauchi. If I'm not working on Human-Swarm interaction, I enjoy cooking and learning Japanese.
